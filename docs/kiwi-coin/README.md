# Kiwi-Coin How-tos

A few instructions to help finding information on [Kiwi-Coin website](https://kiwi-coin.com/).

## Where can I find my User ID?

Once you are logged in on [Kiwi-Coin website](https://kiwi-coin.com/), access the menu [Account](https://kiwi-coin.com/account.html) and click on the **[Profile](https://kiwi-coin.com/account.html#!/profile/)** tab.

It is located in the internal tab **General** as **Used ID**.

## How to create, find or enable the API key?

Once you are logged in on [Kiwi-Coin website](https://kiwi-coin.com/), access the menu [Account](https://kiwi-coin.com/account.html) and click on the **[API](https://kiwi-coin.com/account.html#!/api/)** tab.

If you already have an API key it will be listed otherwise to create a new one, click on the **Add new API-key** button. If you want to trade programatically, using the API, you will need to enable the option **allow trade**.

Once it is added, copy the **Key** and the **Secret** and save it safely (as the secret won't be displayed next time). To be able to use it you need to click on the **Activate** link.

## Request limits

Be aware about how often you can request Kiwi-Coin API:

> _Do not make more than 600 requests per 10 minutes or we will ban your IP address._
